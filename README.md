##Description
Azure's modern data warehouse lets you bring together all your data at any scale easily, and to get insights through analytical dashboards, operational reports, or advanced analytics for all your users. This is accomplished by using a collection of Azure services in unison to provide each layer of functionality. 

The purpose of this solution is to provide an automated and repeatable way to deploy the infrastructure outlined in Microsoft's modern data warehouse architecture. To do this, we're going to utilize HashiCorp's Terraform to templatize the infrastructure.
